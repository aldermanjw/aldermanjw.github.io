<h2>History of Board Games</h2>
<p>According to Peter Attia, at</p><a href=" https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-history-of-board-games-5e622811ce89"> https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-history-of-board-games-5e622811ce89</a><blockquote style="color: #392613; font-size:12 pt; font-family: arial;">Most people don’t realize board games are actually pre-historic, meaning we had board games before we had written language. So, what was the very first game?.. Dice! A piece that’s essential in most board games today was the basis of humanity’s oldest games. A series of 49 small carved painted stones were found at the 5,000-year-old Başur Höyük burial mound in southeast Turkey. These are the earliest gaming pieces ever found. Similar pieces have been found in Syria and Iraq and seem to point to board games originating in the Fertile Crescent. The Crescent is comprised of regions around the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates River in the Middle East. The same region that invented booze, papyrus, breath mints, and calendars, which are also required when planning your game night!</blockquote>
